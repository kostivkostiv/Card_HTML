# Coffee Catalog — HTML & CSS Project

## Project Overview

**ДЗ #1:** Створення базової HTML-структури магазину кави

This is a simple practice assignment in which I created a styled product card using plain HTML and inline styles.  
The goal of this work is to practice layout skills, working with semantic tags `<article>` and `<section>`, using images, and basic typography.

**ДЗ #2:** Каталог товарів та cемантична структура

This project is a practice exercise to build a coffee product catalog using **HTML5 semantic tags** and CSS for layout and styling.  
The main goals of this assignment were:

- Implement a **grid layout** of coffee products using `<ul>` and `<li>` elements.
- Create a **search form** with filters (price, sorting).
- Apply **semantic HTML5 tags** (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`) for better structure and accessibility.
- Use images and typographic styles to make the catalog visually appealing.

## Features

### Sidebar Search Form (`<aside>`)

- Search input field for keyword filtering.
- Price filter dropdown (`<select>`).
- Sort by dropdown (`<select>`).
- All form controls are styled for usability and clarity.

### Product Grid (`<section class="products">`)

- Products displayed in a **grid layout** using CSS Grid.
- Each product is an `<article>` inside an `<li>` item.
- Each product card includes:
  - Image of the coffee product (`<img>`).
  - Product name (`<h5>`).
  - Short description (`<p>`).
  - Price (`<p>`).

### Semantic Structure

- `<main>` contains the primary content.
- `<aside>` for search/filter controls.
- `<section>` wraps the products list.
- `<article>` for each individual product card.
